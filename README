This is a filesystem backed by Riak.

Because there is no write caching, larger files are very slow. 

run mkfs.riak to init the filesystem with a root directory

there are no hardlinks, symlinks and you can't move directories

Get started

install JSON.pm
install Fuse (MacFuse on OSX)
install Fuse.pm

mkfs.riak --server=127.0.0.1:8091 --fsname=testfs
mkdir /tmp/foo
riakfsd  --server=127.0.0.1:8091 --fsname=testfs --mount=/tmp/foo

TODO

* chown
* chmod
* If-Match for edits and restart them if they fail
* Proper vector clock support

* once the semantics are done, rewrite in C for speed
