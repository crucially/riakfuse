This is a filesystem backed by Riak.

Because there is no write caching, larger files are very slow. 

run riak-mkfs to init the filesystem with a root directory

there are no hardlinks, symlinks and you can't move directories

TODO

* chown
* chmod
* HEAD requests when needed
* If-Match for edits and restart them if they fail
* Proper vector clock support
